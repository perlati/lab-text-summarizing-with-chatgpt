    "\n",
    "In this exercise I experimented with few-shot prompting to control the format of the model’s answers rather than just their content. I created three main prompt versions around the same basic task: “Given a short product review, classify its sentiment and extract a short justification.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 1 – Zero-shot, vague formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first version I only wrote instructions in natural language:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral and briefly explain your reasoning. Respond in one line.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This worked reasonably well for the sentiment part, but the formatting was inconsistent. Sometimes the model answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive – the reviewer liked the product overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other times it used bullet points, or long paragraphs, or capitalized the labels differently (“POSITIVE”, “very positive”). When I tried to parse the output programmatically, it was brittle. There were also a few “creative” labels like “mixed” even though I only specified three options. This first version showed that instructions alone are not enough if we care about strictly formatted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2 – Few-shot with lightly structured format\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second version I added three few-shot examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Review: \"The headphones sound amazing.\"\n",
    "Output: positive | clear sound and good performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Review: \"The phone keeps freezing.\"\n",
    "Output: negative | device is unreliable\n",
    "\n",
    "Review: \"The keyboard is okay, nothing special.\"\n",
    "Output: neutral | average experience\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I gave a new review and asked for “Output:”. This dramatically stabilized the behavior. The model reliably used the pattern label | explanation most of the time, and it stopped inventing new labels because the examples made the allowed set very clear. I did still see occasional deviations, e.g. extra text like Sentiment: or adding punctuation in weird places. For human consumption it was fine, but for machine reading it would still need post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 3 – Few-shot with strict JSON schema\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third version I switched the examples to JSON and defined a firm schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"review\": \"I love this camera.\",\n",
    "  \"sentiment\": \"positive\",\n",
    "  \"rationale\": \"image quality and ease-of-use were praised\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I provided a couple of these and then said: “Return only a JSON object with the same keys.” This was the most successful version. The outputs followed the exact structure, the sentiments stayed within the allowed values, and the rationale field was concise. The main failure mode here was when the model slipped and added a trailing comment after the JSON (e.g. // thanks for the review!), or when it inferred extra facts that weren’t in the text (“great battery life”)—a milder form of hallucination. Tightening the instruction (“Do not add comments or extra fields. Do not infer product features that are not mentioned explicitly.”) reduced this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hallucinations and weak spots\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the experiments, hallucinations appeared mostly in two forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label invention when the allowed label set wasn’t clear in the examples (“mixed”, “mostly positive”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Over-interpretation in the rationale or JSON fields, where the model added details that were plausible but not actually in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot examples anchored the model strongly. When the examples were clean and consistent, hallucinations dropped; when the examples themselves were slightly messy, the model happily copied that mess into its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples beat prose. The model treats the examples as a contract. A short schema with two or three good few-shot samples is more effective than a long paragraph of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format is part of the task. If I want JSON, I should show JSON. If I want label | explanation, I should show that pattern. The model is much better at imitation than at obeying vague formatting rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity of examples matters. Including positive, negative, and neutral samples, plus some tricky borderline reviews, made the classifier more robust. If all examples look similar, the model overfits to that pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails must be explicit. Phrases like “don’t invent information” need to be tied to concrete behaviors (“do not mention product features that are not in the review”). Otherwise the model still leans toward being “helpfully imaginative.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is basically programming with data. Designing the examples felt a lot like writing unit tests: I iterated on them until the model’s behavior matched what I wanted. Once the examples and schema were solid, the outputs became predictable enough to be plugged into downstream code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the exercise showed me that few-shot prompting is not just about improving quality; it’s a powerful way to shape and stabilize the structure of the model’s responses."
